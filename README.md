# Quantum Simulator of Space-Time Curvature

A bridge between advanced research and scientific dissemination

Let’s explore the intimate fabric of reality where space, time, and quantum information merge.

This simulator translates the dialogue between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics into visible geometries:

    Vacuum fluctuations become pulsating waves

    Probability amplitudes are dressed in color

    Entanglement weaves violet connections through curved space

It is not just parallel computing on GPUs, but a window into how matter dances with the geometry of spacetime.

Each particle is a cosmic bit that carries with it:

|Ψ〉 = α|0〉 + β|1〉 (quantum state)

ds² = gᵤᵥdxᵘdxᵛ (spacetime geometry)

What was pure mathematical abstraction a century ago now becomes a sensory experience.

We are mapping the frontier where being becomes becoming - where quantum possibilities crystallize into physical reality through the filter of gravitational curvature.

Because as Wheeler and Rovelli teach:

"Spacetime is not the backdrop of the universe - it is the quantized protagonist."
